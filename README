This is a collection of my dotfiles and scripts, created for getting a new
computer up and running quickly.  The intent is to check the folder out into my
home directory then run setup.sh to download other software, create symlinks,
etc.

Feel free to use anything in here in any way, except to the extent that any of
these have some specific license.  Which is currently none of them and
hopefully I'll remember to change this README if that should change.
